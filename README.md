Completed Assigement
I am done my assigement .I am facing an issue with the assignment of CROS  error . 
I have tested the API in the API client they are working fine in there but the strict CORS policy backend is blocking request data of other origins in the browser. 


I tested the API using Postman and it's working smoothly.
